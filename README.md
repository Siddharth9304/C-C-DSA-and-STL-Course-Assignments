This repository contains solutions to all the assignments I completed during the live C, C++, DSA, and STL course taught by Saurabh Shukla Sir, popularly known as MySirg on YouTube.

The course spanned 6 months (from February 26, 2024 to September 13, 2024), and I solved over 700 problems throughout the program. These assignments played a key role in enhancing my programming skills and problem-solving abilities.
